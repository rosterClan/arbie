## About The Project
A few years ago, I discovered arbitrage betting—a strategy that involves placing bets on every possible outcome of an event to secure a guaranteed profit. For example, in a basketball game where both teams offer fixed odds of 50-to-1, placing a one-dollar bet on each team would guarantee a $48 profit. I aimed to develop a system that aggregates horse racing data from various bookmakers in real time to identify arbitrage opportunities. This system emulated the real-time data delivery mechanisms of several bookmakers, which required reverse engineering each bookmaker’s front-end system. I recreated the processes for generating authentication tokens and the API call structures necessary to acquire horse racing data from events across Australia.
